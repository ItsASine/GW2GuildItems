# GW2GuildItems
A 'spreadsheet' of the items the GW2 guild owns and items related transactions

## Goals
1. Have a list of names of who has donated to the guild, and how many items have been donated by each</li>
* Have a list of items currently in all guild locations, stash and treasury</li>
* Have a list of all item related transactions in the guild, as a master list</li>
* Make it generic so many guilds could use it should they choose</li>
